For the semester long project, which has to be planned and designed for a specific location, students demonstrate creativity in applying theories and methodologies from their design and analysis subjects while considering the project's technical, environmental, and social feasibility. Parallel to this design project are smaller projects involving actual building. Lectures on a variety of civil and environmental engineering projects, engineering practice and ethics, as well as field trips, are also part of the subject. Instruction and practice in oral and written communication are an integral part, culminating in the completion of the design portfolio.",

The broad range of engineering applications for these optimization formulations will also be emphasized.

The connections between theory and practice are realized in the design exercises. Required design reviews precede the LTA race competition. The performance, weight, and principle characteristics of the LTA vehicles are estimated and illustrated using physics, mathematics, and chemistry known to freshmen, the emphasis being on the application of this knowledge to aerospace engineering and design rather than on exposure to new science and mathematics.

            "description": "While this seminar provides an overview of recent literature, its principal purpose is to help graduate students develop skills suited to production of research papers and/or dissertations. Begins by reviewing general theoretical and methodological issues, then turns to specific empirical studies that examine the effects of systems structure, national attributes, bargaining processes, institutions, ideas, and norms on security affairs and political economy. The last two sessions of the seminar are devoted to evaluating research proposals generated by all members of the class.",

Interactions are also described, including effects of biological scatterers on geological measurements, and effects of seafloor scattering on measurements of biological scatterers on, in, or immediately above the seafloor.  Methods of determining small-scale material properties of organisms and the seafloor are outlined. Operational methods are emphasized, and corresponding measurement theory is described.

Students master the materials via problem sets that are directly related to, and coordinated with, the deliverables of their project.

Also considers Han Chinese internal migration to frontier regions like Taiwan. Topics include the varied roles of Chinese migrants in colonial, settler and frontier societies, the coolie trade, Chinese exclusion movements, transnational networks, marital and chain migration, immigrant community formation, women's roles, second-generation \"roots seeking\", the new migration, and the reciprocal relationship between contemporary Chinese migration to Africa and African migration to China.

Covers Chinese migration to locations such as Southeast Asia, Hawaii, North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, Australia, Europe, India and Africa. Also considers Han Chinese internal migration to frontier regions like Taiwan. Topics include the varied roles of Chinese migrants in colonial, settler and frontier societies, the coolie trade, Chinese exclusion movements, transnational networks, marital and chain migration, immigrant community formation, women's roles, second-generation \"roots seeking\", the new migration, and the reciprocal relationship between contemporary Chinese migration to Africa and African migration to China. Critically examines the degree to which this transnational migration has produced a \"Global Chinese\" identity. Taught in English.",

Readings, screenings and written work hone students? analytical capacity. Students taking the graduate version complete additional assignments. Students from the Graduate Program in Science Writing center their work on topics in science, technology, engineering, and/or medicine.",

Two related projects introduce a range of disciplinary issues, such as working with precedents, site, sectional and spatial proposition of the building, and the performance of the outer envelope. Emphasizes the clarity of intentions and the development of appropriate architectural and representational solutions. Limited to first-year MArch students.",

First, students investigate the design and use of games and simulations in the classroom (including commercial off-the-shelf games), as well as the research and development issues associated with desktop computer-based, mobile, and non-computer based media. Students then develop their own simulations and games, study what and how others learn from them (including field testing of products), and how games and simulations can be implemented in educational settings. All levels of computer experience welcome. Graduate students are expected to complete additional assignments.",

Techniques include animations developed from hand-drawn illustrations, data-flow diagrams, and computer-designed visual stories. No previous drawing experience required. Work centers on readings, visualization exercises, and a final project. Visualizations can be done in any preferred medium. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.",

Topics include general mechanisms of disease (inflammation, infection, immune injury, transplantation, genetic disorders and neoplasia); pathology of lipids, enzymes, and molecular transporters; pathology of major organ systems; and review of diagnostic tools from surgical pathology to non-invasive techniques such as spectroscopy, imaging, and molecular markers of disease. The objectives of this subject are achieved by a set of integrated lectures and laboratories, as well as a student-driven term project leading to a formal presentation on a medical, socioeconomic, or technological issue in human pathology. Only HST students enrolled in specific degree programs may register under HST.034, graded P/D/F. Credit cannot also be received for HST.030 or HST.031.",

Students meet in study groups of five to six participants with facilitators trained in effective classroom techniques and concept focus. The study groups help students to reinforce concepts learned in the regular curriculum, and help them to gain mastery of concepts and problems that are often more challenging than those dealt with during lecture. The small study group format emphasizes the full participation of each student with the facilitator acting as a guide. The regularity of weekly meetings enhances the students' understanding of MIT's academic expectations. After the initial meetings, students are encouraged to take more responsibility and to lead the group in problem-solving sessions, which helps to maximize their own learning. Each study group meets for a minimum of three hours each week. The meeting time is set by the XL facilitator based on students' schedules.",

            "description": "Considers ethical questions that have arisen from the growth of biomedical research and the health-care industry since World War II. Should doctors be allowed to help patients end their lives? If so, when and how? Should embryos be cloned for research and/or reproduction? Should parents be given control over the genetic make-up of their children? What types of living things are appropriate to use as research subjects? How should we distribute scarce and expensive medical resources? Draws on philosophy, history, and anthropology to show how problems in bioethics can be approached from a variety of perspectives.",

Discussions and readings organized around three questions: what cultural effects and risks follow from treating biology as technology; how computers have changed the way we think about ourselves and others; and how politics are built into our infrastructures. Explores the forces behind technological and cultural change; how technological and cultural artifacts are understood and used by different communities; and whether, in what ways, and for whom technology has produced a better world.
